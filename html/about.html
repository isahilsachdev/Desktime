            DeskTime was born out of the need for the
            <a href=""> Draugiem Group</a> to manage their many employees. An
            internal application was developed, and we soon realized that we'd
            made a tool that could be useful for many other companies. Why not
            offer it to them? - we thought. And so, the development began.
            <br /><br />At DeskTime, we’re committed to accountability,
            transparency, and fairness. DeskTime is a product designed to
            increase productivity in an open and empowering environment. The
            added benefit? Boosting your employees and motivating them to
            perform at 100% of their potential.
